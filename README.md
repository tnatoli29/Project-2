We continued our ETL (put link) on USA Olympic Gold Medal wins from 1976-2016. We created a Dashboard web application that utilized D3, Plotly and Leaflet to create visualizations of the number of gold medal winners by sport and by gender. With our Leaflet map we displayed the locations of each Olympic host country in each year. We connected our Leaflet map to a Flask app to render on the dashboard for public use. 

Visualizations included:
* pie-chart displaying male and female athletes per year including the percentage of each per year.
* multi-line chart to display both male and female athletes per year.
* bar-chart showing the number of gold medals obtain by each sport in the USA.
* satelite and street map displaying the world and olympic game locations for their given year.
